Computational Trust models
=============

Context
-------
This project was done for the subject AIAD at FEUP. The purpose of this assignment was to compare some computational trust models and the interaction between agents.

Approach
--------
It was created a game where there is an agent who asks questions, there are some who answers and some agents who have knowledge in some fields (wise agents). At each round of the game a question is asked, and each answer agent asks the question to the wise agent it believes is the best to answer that kind of question and then answers back to the question agent. With this approach each answer agent has a different algorithm so, in theory, the agent who has the best ratio has the best algorithm.
